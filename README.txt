This is a small portfolio project for the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course. 

The objective is to create a webpage with a simple portfilio of my initial work as a developer!

For now it will only have one or two projects, but maybe in the future I will use this one as my main portfolio.

Hope you enjoy my work!
