                <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I am a aspiring software developer seeking my first full-time job in the technology field. I have a degree in architecture and urban planning from the Federal University of Pernambuco, with experience in the development and management of residential and corporate projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently following a career path as a full-stack engineer, but my primary focus is on growing as a front-end developer to leverage my experience working with human intuition and a functional approach to problem-solving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a professional with over ten years of experience in architecture and construction, my main strengths are analytical thinking and problem-solving. My work mainly involved collaborating with different teams, performing various roles simultaneously on the same project. These experiences allowed me to learn and enhance crucial interpersonal skills such as communication, adaptability, and organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a curious individual who enjoys learning new technologies. My joy comes from creating things and solving puzzles, and I am always looking for ways to make my work more effective and efficient.
                    </p>
