                    <p>
                        HHHi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my chances of winning big.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fun fact! I've been programing for 6,567,426,714 seconds!
                    </p>
